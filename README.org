* git-sourcing
=git-sourcing= is a Clojure library to help you source information from a remote repository.
** Functions
It contains two functions, =get-repo= and =init=.
*** =get-repo=
Either returns the local repo, performing a =git clone= from the remote repo if it doesn't exist.
*** =init=
Starts synchronising the remote and local repositories.
**** Options
It supports an option map as an optional third parameter. It currently supports one entry =:period= with a =clj-time= period as its value. This specifies how often the remote-repo should be checked for updates.
These can be created a such, where =t= is =clj.time/core=.
